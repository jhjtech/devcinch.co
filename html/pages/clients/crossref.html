<p>Crossref makes research outputs easy to find, cite, link, assess, and
reuse.</p>
<p>Crossref metadata is open and available for reuse without
restriction. There are currently 156,563,111 records, these include
information about research objects like articles, grants and awards,
preprints, conference papers, book chapters, datasets, and more.</p>
<p>The information covers elements like titles, contributors,
descriptions, dates, references, connecting identifiers such as Crossref
DOIs, ROR IDs and ORCID iDs, together with all sorts of metadata that
helps to determine provenance, trust, and reusabilityâ€”such as funding,
clinical trial, and license information.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate all of this Crossref has a number of large
code bases and we have carried out a number of challenging projects for
them.</p>
<p>They have a wide range of infrastructure and projects often involve
pulling together lots of disparate data sources and presenting a unified
data format via their many APIs.</p>

<p>We've worked with JHJ a number of times over the past five years.
They have contributed features and bugfixes to our Clojure and Kotlin
Spring Boot codebases.</p>
<p>They have always been quick to pick up the context of our codebases,
flexible, and have got started quickly.</p>

<p>We have carried out substantial work on their widely consumed public
REST API. This exposes the metadata that members deposit with Crossref
when they register their content. And it's not just the bibliographic
metadata either: funding data, license information, full-text links,
ORCID iDs, abstracts, and Crossmark updates are in members' metadata
too. You can search, facet, filter, or sample metadata from thousands of
members, and the results are returned in JSON.</p>
