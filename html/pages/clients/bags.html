<p>BAGS or Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service offers
gambling-betting services.</p>
<p>Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Services Ltd provides gambling and
betting services. The Company offers live and virtual greyhound racing,
betting and other relevant information.</p>
<p>BAGS was in desperate need of technology help. They were relying on
outdated systems with large support costs, infrastructure that was
unreliable and difficult to manage, with no capability to innovate and
iterate on their product.</p>
<p>We worked closely with BAGS stakeholders to build a modern, scalable,
and secure platform that they could build on for the coming decades.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Saved our business huge sums of money by replacing a legacy thick
client application with a modern web based solution, removing the need
for large amounts of private network infrastructure.</p>
<p>Understanding the problem and coming up with great solutions is what
these guys do, the team are approachable and fantastic communicators to
all stakeholders and their technical expertise is second to none.</p>

<p>The fundamentals of this platform are in the many data integrations
required, we worked closely with integration partners to facilitate 10+
fully featured data integrations, ranging from betting data to
governance and compliance.</p>
<p>With these integrations in place we embarked on a project to surface
this data to a number of new, purpose built front ends.</p>
<p>After migrating to their new platform BAGS could decommission many
other systems that were no longer fit for purpose, this resulted in
substantial cost savings.</p>
<p>We continue to work closely with BAGS and since 2019 have been
running and supporting all of their production infrastructure and
continuing to innovate on their product.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Working with BAGS has been seamless and our new platform has been
well received. It is fantastic to be a part of a long term project that
has saved BAGS a substantial amount of money.</p>
