#+TITLE: Devcinch: Software Development as a Service

* A unique take on software development - it's a cinch

** Software Development as a Service to scale your business.

Our subscription product Devcinch allows you access to a software developer, replacing
unreliable freelancers and expensive agencies for one flat monthly fee.

We specialise in speed of delivery and excel when working with our clients in an async nature.

The annual cost of a full-time senior developer now exceeds Â£65,000, that's not including benefits!

You may not always have enough work to keep them busy and you can't easily stop paying them, not only is Devcinch
cheaper over a 12 month period but you can cancel at any time!
